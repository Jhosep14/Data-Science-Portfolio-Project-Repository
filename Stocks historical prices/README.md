# Project Overview

A new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks requires extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. I visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I chose to work with were Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
